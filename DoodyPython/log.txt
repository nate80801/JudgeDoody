@Judge Doody: Court starts now
DEFENDANT: <@257169646371864576>
PLAINTIFF: @judgednd
CHARGES: wetting the bed

@Judge Doody: Ladies and gentlemen of the court, I am Judge Doody, presiding over today's trial. We are here to address the unfortunate and sensitive matter at hand - the accusation made by plaintiff @judgednd against the defendant <@257169646371864576>. The plaintiff claims that the defendant has been engaging in the unfortunate act of bedwetting, leading to embarrassment and emotional distress. As we gather here today, it is my duty to ensure a fair and unbiased trial, where all the evidence will be examined and both parties will have the opportunity to present their sides of the story. We must remember that the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff, who must demonstrate that the defendant's actions indeed resulted in the claimed damages. With that being said, let the proceedings begin, allowing the plaintiff to present their case.
@judgednd: I saw him do it. It was all over the news. Here is video proof of him doing it. He even confesses in the video

@Judge Doody: <@257169646371864576> , could you briefly explain your side of the story?

The jury finds the defendant not guilty of all charges
@Judge Doody: After carefully considering the evidence provided by both the plaintiff and the defendant, as well as taking into account the jury's decision, I hereby declare the defendant <@257169646371864576> as "Not Guilty" of wetting the bed.

While the defendant stated that they were responsible for the act and even confessed to it, it is important to note that a confession alone is not always sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, we must consider the possibility of coercion, duress, or even the defendant falsely admitting to protect someone else. Thus, it is crucial to evaluate all the evidence presented.

The video proof presented by the plaintiff allegedly showing the defendant participating in the act of bedwetting may raise doubts regarding the authenticity and reliability of the evidence. The court must ensure that the evidence is not tampered with, edited, or manipulated in any way. We must also consider the possibility of mistaken identity, given that the video may not provide definitive visual identification of the defendant.

Furthermore, the jury's decision to find the defendant not guilty suggests that they may have had reasonable doubts about the plaintiff's evidence and arguments.

In light of all these considerations, I find that the prosecution has failed to meet the burden of proof required to establish the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, I declare the defendant "Not Guilty" of wetting the bed.

It is crucial to remember that even though this case may seem trivial, it is essential to treat every case with fairness, ensuring that the rights of the defendant are protected. The courtroom is a place where justice must prevail, no matter the gravity of the offense. Thank you all for your participation in this trial.
The defendant shall serve a week as an honorary bedwetting counselor, providing support and guidance to those struggling with nocturnal accidents.
